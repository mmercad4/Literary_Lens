# Literary_Lens
To run our software application begin with cloning the repo. <br />
You will need MongoDB and Nodejs to run our project. <br />
Once cloned navigate to the base, Backend, and literary-lens directoryies and run "npm i" to include the correct node_modules. <br />
<br />
If there isn't an ".env" file in the Backend directory, create one. <br />
You can then edit environment variables like MONGO_URI, PORT, and GEMINI_API_KEY.<br />
Now run "npm start" in both the Backend and literary-lens directories to begin the server.<br />
Your server is now running and you can go to localhost at port 3000 to access the project
