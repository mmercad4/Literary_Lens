# Literary_Lens
To run our software application begin with cloning the repo. <br />
You will need MongoDB and Nodejs to run our project. <br />
Once cloned navigate to the base, Backend, and literary-lens directoryies and run "npm i" to include the correct node_modules. <br />
<br />
You can edit environment variables like the locations of the mongodb database in the ".env" file.<br />
Now run "npm start" in both the Backend and literary-lens directories to begin the server.<br />
